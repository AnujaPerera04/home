</p> 
<h2> History </h2> 
The raptors where founded in 1995 along with the Vancover Grizzlies as a Canadian expansion. Their early years had small playoffs runs lead by Vince Carter, 
<br>
who was Toronto's star player. The Raptors went through a dry patch in the mid 2000's but came back with the help of Demar Derozan and Kyle Lowry. The Raptors 
<br>
had many playoff runs and capped it off with a NBA Title in 2019. The first NBA Championship outside of the US.
<p>
 The Toronto Raptors start their Pre season on Tuesday October 8th. The Raptors are starting their season as defending 
 <br>
 champions but are missing a key player in Kawai Leonard. Kawai has 
	singed a contract with the Clippers after leading the Raptors to 
	<br>
	their first championship. 
	Hopefully we can see the raptors repeat this season.
