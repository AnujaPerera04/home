	<h2> About the Toronto Teams </h2>
	<p> 
	 The city of Toronto has a long history of the sport with successful teams in the NHL, MLB, NBA, and MLS. The recent triumph of the Toronto Raptors in the NBA has capped off another successful year for sports teams in Toronto. The largest sports team in Toronto by are far the Toronto Maple Leafs. 
	 Toronto's love and affiliation for hockey goes way back to the NHL's original six teams and has made for the biggest hockey market in the world. The Toronto Maple Leafs won their last championship back in 1967 and were founded in 1917 making them the oldest professional team still existing in Toronto. 
	 The Toronto Raptors were founded in 1995 and won their first championship this year! Toronto's basketball culture has been spreading for years now ever since the Raptors were established. Both the Toronto Raptors and Maple Leafs play at the Air Canada Centre in downtown Toronto. There are more and more Canadian basketball players 
	 entering the NBA and the Raptors have become an extremely popular team in not only Toronto but all of Canada. The Toronto Blue Jays were founded in 1977 and went back to back with championships in 1992 and 1993. Baseball is also a massive sport in Toronto. The Toronto Blue Jays play at the Rogers Centre in downtown Toronto. While not
	 as popular as Basketball and Hockey due to the lack of success in recent years by the Blue Jays, baseball is still a popular sport in Toronto and Canada. The Toronto Football Club was founded in 2005. They are an extremely new team in Toronto but have taken the city by storm. They won the MLS cup in 2017 and have qualified for the CONCACAF
	 champions league for the past 2 years. Soccer is a relatively new sport to Toronto but it has become extremely popular and has created many quality youth players through the years. TFC play at BMO stadium in downtown Toronto beside the CNE.
